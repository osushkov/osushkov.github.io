title: Hello World
---

Hello, my name is Oleg and welcome to my blog! I intend for this blog to be mainly about programming and software, but may have a few other topics randomly thrown in. My plan is to mostly treat this as a sort of personal diary/stream of consciousness outlet, rather that trying to create some kind of publicly popular blog. So don't really expect too much in terms of production values.

A bit about myself: I'm a software engineer currently living in Sydney Australia. My tech-related interests are in the areas of programming, robotics and machine learning, so the things I write about will definitely tend to lean in that direction. But really, anything tech related is fair game I think. I expect most of my posts will be relatively short and "ranty", just because writing long well-structured arguments sounds like too much work.

```C++
int main(void) {
  printf("hello world\n");
  return 0;
}
```
